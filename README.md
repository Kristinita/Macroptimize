Macroptimize
=============

##### A plugin for Sublime Text 3 to make working with macros less clunky.

##### Allows for quick selection of any macro to run in Sublime packages. Just ctrl+alt+z and select which macro to run.

##### Any questions or issues with the plugin, please let me know: johnwiegert@outlook.com

Please go easy on me if any of this is poor python style, this was my first time using the language for a project.
