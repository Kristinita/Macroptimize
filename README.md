Macroptimize
=============

##### A plugin for Sublime Text 3 to make working with macros less clunky.

##### Allows for quick selection of any macro to run in Sublime packages.

Install this plugin with [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/).

## Usage

Just ctrl+alt+z and select which macro to run.

## TODO

-Repeat until end of file setting (maybe even per macro)
-Replace current buffer macro with last run macro
-Key binding for running last selected macro

## Miscellaneous

##### Any questions or issues with the plugin, please let me know: johnwiegert@outlook.com

Please go easy on me if any of this is poor python style, this was my first time using the language for a project.
